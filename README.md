# In-Season Website

This is a project to show folks what fruits and vegetables are in-season at the current time of the year. Data for fruit and vegetable seasonality was taken from https://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/whatsavailable and https://www.usfoods.com/content/dam/usf/pdf/produce/Freshness-Guide.pdf.

This site is built using React, Vite, and deployed on Netlify
